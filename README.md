# Yahoo Finance Stock Sentiment Analyser

This project was a collaboration between [Haz-ctrl](https://github.com/Haz-ctrl) and [malik1234](https://github.com/malik1234), where we made a Python program to display stock information by collecting market data from the Yahoo Finance API, in addition to using NLP techniques to provide a recent news analysis sentiment about a selected stock.

# Getting started
## Cloning repository
Run the following command from the directory on your local machine that you wish to clone the repo into:\
`git clone https://github.com/Haz-ctrl/yahoo-finance-stock-sentiment-analyser.git`

## Installing packages
Install the project dependencies by installing from the provided `requirements.txt` file by running:\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Generate a new requirements.txt file
If a new package is added, or new version of an existing package is installed, a new `requirements.txt` file can be generated by running the following commands from the project root:\
```
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs ./ --force
```

Where the `--force` flag is used to overwrite an existing `requirements.txt` file.

# Run program locally
Once all packages have been installed, you can execute the program from the project root by running:\
`python src/main.py`

# Troubleshooting
If Yahoo Finance's API gives a 404 client error for a ticker you know for a fact is existent, try upgrading the `yfinance` package by running:\
`pip install yfinance --upgrade --no-cache-dir`

# Additional resources
Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance/blob/main/README.md) for the `yfinance` package
